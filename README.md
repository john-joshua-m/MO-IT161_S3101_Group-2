* **Dynamic Information:** Displays current system time and includes placeholders for external **Weather API** and **Quote of the Day API** integration.
* **Dark Mode Toggle:** Easily switches between light and dark themes for user comfort.
* **Handwriting Font:** Uses the **Pacifico** Google Font for a distinct, personal aesthetic.

## Installation & Setup

Since this is a client-side web application, no server is required for basic viewing.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    Github Repo: https://github.com/john-joshua-m/MO-IT161_S3101_Group-2
    ```
2.  **Open:** Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

### Development Note

The application is styled with a custom CSS framework using **Calibri** as the primary system font and **Pacifico** (imported) for script elements. The layout is optimized for mobile screens via a `@media` query, which will soon be implemented.
